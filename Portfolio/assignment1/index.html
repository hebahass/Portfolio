						<p>When I was just a girl, I expected the world. But it flew away from my reach, so I ran away in my sleep. And at first I was afraid, I was petrified. Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side. But then I spent so many night thinking how he did me wrong, and I grew strong! I learned how to get along. However, I get too hungry for dinner at eight. I love the theater, and never come late. I never bother with people I hate. That's why this lady is a tramp.</p>
